      BUIDL IT - The metaverse YOU BUIDL<BR><BR>
      This project is possible because as an individual I spend all my waking hours<BR>
      understanding and learning new things and technologies.<br>
      As such any donations that I receive whether they are $1 or $100 help me as an <BR>
      individual to justify my time (to myself and my wife) at my computer developing <br>
      in this way and in the same breath I can dedicate a my fulltime workload to these projects.<br><br>
